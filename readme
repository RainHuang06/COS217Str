What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This assignment was greatly helpful in helping me understand
pointers. It was a bit "grindy" as many functions needed
implementation, and the debugging was a bit painful in all 
honesty - but I'd say I had fun implementing these
functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

There are no bugs that I know of, but potentially
there may be a small bug with replace going over the
null terminator of the string and venturing
into undefined text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.
No, because if assert is called on an argument, it will try to
look for the size of a pointer. However, since pointers are always
8 bytes on armlab, no useful information is gained.
